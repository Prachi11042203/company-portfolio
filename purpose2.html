    <p id="para">What's better than building the next big thing? It's doing so while never letting go of the little things that matter. None of the amazing things we do at Infosys would be possible without an equally amazing culture, the environment in which to do them, one where ideas can flourish, and where you are empowered to move forward as far as your ideas will take you. This is something we achieve through cultivating a culture of inclusiveness and openness, and a mindset of exploration and applied innovation. A career at Infosys means experiencing and contributing to this environment every day. It means being a part of a dynamic culture where we are united by a common purpose:</p><b>To amplify human potential and create the next opportunity for people, businesses and communities.</b>

<h1>Diversity and Inclusion</h1>
<br>
<h5>Welcome to a meritocracy of ideas.</h5>
If an innovation has to serve a diverse set of people, it has to come from people of diverse backgrounds. It’s that simple. That’s why we have people from all walks of life – of different interests, genders, and orientations from over 150 nationalities, operating out of over 56 countries. Come, be defined by your skills, ideas and attitude, not your ability, race, sexuality, or nationality.
<br> <br>
<h5>Equal Employment Opportunity</h5>
Infosys values diversity and inclusion, and is committed to the principles of equal employment opportunity. We comply with all applicable laws prohibiting discrimination or harassment against any applicant or employee. This prohibition includes, without limitation, discrimination based on age, race, color, gender, national origin, religion, creed, disability, covered veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, marital status, citizenship status, ancestry, amnesty, and any other personal characteristic protected by applicable law. This policy applies to all personnel actions, including but not limited to recruitment, hiring, placement, promotion, transfer, separation, compensation, benefits, training, and education.
